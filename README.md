# Yo! I'm Lucus :metal:

Backstory on the Github account name: Several years ago I created an LLC for doing consulting work - I called it 3Sigma Technologies because "It isn't perfect, but it's pretty damned close" was kind of my operational paradigm at the time...and still is. With that out of the way, let me quickly overview what you'll find in my assorted repos then talk about what I have done and am looking to do.

I've been writing code for the better part of 20 years now which makes me "experienced" but not "experienced" - I know what I'm doing, most of the time, but I've barely scratched the surface on what can be done. In that time, I've worked with more coding languages and markup than I care to think about - VB6, VBA, Matlab, LaTeX, Python, Javascript, C#, SQL/T-SQL, C++, CUDA, React, CSS/SASS (probably more, but you get the idea)...and enough Ruby, PHP, and Java to know I could probably figure them out (but I'll go to my grave despising Ruby's `unless` keyword).

This means, roughly, I can do what needs doing when it comes to software (or figure it out in short order). It also means when I'm unemployed for extended periods - like in 2023 - I can keep myself sharp by learning and working on things that I'm curious about. 

For example, so far in 2023 I've:
- Learned how [SVGs work](https://github.com/3SigmaTech/hyper-venn), and learned to [draw them manually](https://github.com/3SigmaTech/3sigma-logo).
- Made my first [NPM package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/zendesk-translations-writer). Well, that is my second; this is [my first](https://www.npmjs.com/package/hyper-venn) but I linked to it in my first bullet.
- Learned how to use [Github Actions](https://github.com/3SigmaTech/s8s-gtable/tree/main/.github/workflows) - though I know I've only scratched the surface on this.
    - I have used Bitbucket and Azure CI/CD pipelines in the past, so Actions were easy to pick up.
- Wrote a [Zendesk App](https://www.zendesk.com/marketplace/apps/support/916557/auto-assigner/?queryID=24afb2e5641341014b91b982b9d9a036). I'm not expecting to make much, if any, money off of it (it solves a _very_ niche problem) but I enjoyed learning the process.
    - I was also legitimately curious if one could create an app for less than $1.00 per agent per month (when priced per agent) because that was the lowest nonzero cost I'd seen in the marketplace. As you can see, the answer is yes.
- Went a whole lot deeper into [Gulp build scripts](https://github.com/3SigmaTech/s8s-build) than I thought I ever would (And hooooooly $#!& did I spend an inordinate amount of time working the kinks out of those...writing your front end, back end, and build system all in typescript really makes for some interesting challenges).
    - As a quick aside: some of you are looking at the above and thinking, "Why not just use Webpack?" And in retrospect, that was probably the right way to go. But the above was a gradual evolution of tinkering...I did not set out to create a monstrosity of a build script. (Small by enterprise standards, but big for the kinds of podunk projects I use it on.)
- Learned React - at least, I think I [learned React](https://github.com/3SigmaTech/s8s-actionlist). I don't have [m]any React developers in my immediate circle to validate my knowledge. The code works; it's clean (to me); and React makes building front ends rather fun.
    - I never had a major disliking for jQuery, but the concept of a Virtual DOM is...refreshing. And I always found Angular to be overwrought - if you're putting that much logic in your view layer, you're doing it wrong. But I suppose that's something of an unpopular opinion.
- Found out you can [create entity diagrams in Readme files](https://github.com/3SigmaTech/3Sigma-Surveys)! THAT IS SO AWESOME!!!
    - The above repo is part of a collection of Salesforce repos (including [this one](https://github.com/3SigmaTech/3sigma-invites) and [this one](https://github.com/3SigmaTech/3sigma-reports)) I had laying around from past work. These repos came about from Step 2 of the sequence of `Have Problem ` &#8594; ` Prototype [Removable] Solution ` &#8594; ` Implement [Longterm] Solution`. So, while they do what they're supposed to, they are a good deal removed from "production grade".
- ...
- Wrote an [obtusely long self-introduction](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Y4dg5QyOExf5WgZldZP5R3u8c13K4jZG/edit#).
- Walking my German Shepherd until she doesn't want to walk anymore. (It can be done! All it takes is 5-7 miles per day...)
- Got back (getting back) in shape - and teaching some friends how to do the same.
  - For those interested, here is [a fairly NSFW overview](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1lcc9W6jf807RrWAjMYIdhg6Wmy0mO_EdptkUOZIlByc/edit#heading=h.qfz8udzamj37) of the approach I take. 
- Worked on go-to-market and market discovery strategies for [Section 8 Secrets](https://www.section8secrets.net/).
- Started using [Salesforce Trailblazer](https://trailblazer.me/id/lvanblaircum1) in May '23 to _finally_ get some certifications.
    - I've been an admin, developer, and implementation consultant for many years but never bothered with the certs. I'm rectifying that now (Certified Admin, Advanced Admin, and App Builder thus far; hoping to rep out a few more in the coming couple of months).

# Consulting

Generally speaking, I work with folks whose situations fall into one of three main categories:

1. You're not sure what to do next.
    - Or, more commonly, you're not sure what to _prioritize_ next.
    - Examples: you need your Salesforce installation optimized but you don't know where to start, or you're looking at a Customer Operations program (training, QA, processes, analytics) that needs to be upleveled and aren't sure the best approach.
1. You know what to do next, but you're not sure how to do it.
    - Examples: you need some Salesforce admin or development work done or you need a custom Zendesk app or workflow configured.
1. You know what to do and how to do it, but don't have time.
    - Examples: you have a fully utilized core engineering team but have an urgent need to integrate your product with whatever tool or platform, or your CRM Team is currently prioritizing revenue team requests but your service department has needs.

Not sure if I'm the right person to talk to? Hit me up - I'll help you out or point you in the right direction.

# TODO
- Port self-introduction into three(?) sections:
    - Career path (Resume++)
    - Operating Methods
    - Leadership Principles
